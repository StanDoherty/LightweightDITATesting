      <p class="p">Your <span class="ph">Remote Lighting Network</span> remote control can manage up to 250 network light bulbs on the same lighting
        network. When you add a light bulb to the network, you can program it to one or more
        lighting groups. You must assign a light bulb to at least one lighting group to
        operate that light bulb  A network light bulb that is not programmed to a
        lighting group will still operate when controlling all network light bulbs from
        the remote control.</p>

          the light bulb(s) are added to the group. If the indicator flashes red, the
          lighting group was not activated and you must try again. Light flashes red for 3
          seconds if programming fails.</p>

          remote control to turn the light bulbs on and off. Also remember to turn on any
